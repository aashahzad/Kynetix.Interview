# Refactoring test in C#

## Description

This is a simple application written to enable us test your experience with code refactoring. 
You are asked to refactor the Trade.Api project, assume that the code is sound in terms of business logic and only focus on applying clean code principles. Keep in mind acronyms such as SOLID, KISS, DRY and YAGNI.

Please create a new branch from master and push your changes no later than the day before the skills interview. This gives us the opportunity to review your work and prepare appropriate questions for the interview

Try to keep this exercise below 2 hours. If you still have things you can improve after the 2 hour mark please note this down as a discussion point during the interview.

- For testing the API you can use some valid reference data from the SampleData folder to create a valid trade.
  - Or you can call the `ReferenceData.Api` to get a list of valid reference data.
- You are at liberty to change the structure of the `Trade.Api` project as you see fit.

PLEASE DO NOT COMMIT ANY CHANGES TO THE MASTER BRANCH

## Limitations
The `MarketData.Api` and `ReferenceData.Api` may not be changed. These projects are not part of the solution and are only there to simulate external dependencies.
